{"name":"NorMC","tagline":"A Norm Compliance Temporal Logic Model Checker","body":"This is a public git repository for the NorMC -- a Norm Compliance Temporal Logic Model Checker. The paper that fully documents the model checker is included in the download tarball (or the git repository if you wish to clone/fork it).\r\n\r\n# Installation and Usage\r\n\r\nNorMC is written in [Haskell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)), and it needs a [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/) interpreter to run. You can download GHC from its homepage, but a simpler and better way is to download the whole [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/). Both Haskell and GHC are free to use and available for Windows, Mac, Linux, and other platforms.\r\n\r\nIn order to run NorMC, you have to load its files into the GHC interpreter:\r\n\r\n`$ ghci NCCTL.hs`\r\n\r\nYou can also load the examples mentioned in the paper, either from the shell (as above) or from within the GHCi command line:\r\n\r\n`Prelude> :l Ex02.hs`\r\n\r\nCurrent version of NorMC cannot be compiled as a standalone Haskell program, and it always needs GHC to run. Also, NorMC is not compatible with Hugs, and has not been tested with any other Haskell interpreters.\r\n\r\nMore detailed documentation can be found in the [manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkazmierczak/NorMC/master/ManualSimpleExample.pdf).\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2011, University of Bergen.
